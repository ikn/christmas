Unintentional Christmas Tree: a game where red and green blocks fall towards an
floor of alternating colours.

This was made for Pirate Kart V in February 2012.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

./configure
./run

    PLAYING

Use the arrow keys to move the floor left and right.  If a block lands where
the floor is a different colour to itself, something bad happens depending on
the mode; otherwise, it stays where it lands.  Press space to release all
landed blocks and gain points; the more blocks on the ground, the more points
you get.

    CONTROLS

left/right, A/D: move.
1, 2: select a mode on the title screen.
1, 2, enter, space: continue at the lose screen.
escape, backspace: pause/unpause.

A/D works for other keyboard layouts too: QWERTZ, AZERTY, Dvorak, Colemak.

To quit, close the window.  Easy mode does not have a lose condition.
